# File Path Commenter README

Effortlessly add relative file path comments to the top of your code files with the File Path Commenter extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension is designed to enhance your workflow, especially when leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI assistants to write and manage your code.

## Features

- **Automatic File Path Comments:** Automatically insert the relative path of your file as a comment at the top of your code files upon opening.
- **Language Support:** Supports a wide range of programming languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua, and many more.
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Ensures the comment is only added if it doesn't already exist, preventing duplicate comments.
